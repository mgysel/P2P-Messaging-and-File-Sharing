# Peerster

Peerster was created as homework for Decentralized Systems Engineering.

Peerster is a peer-to-peer messaging and file-sharing application with unicast and gossip messaging, routing for one-to-one communication, data sharing in the manner of BitTorrent, and an implementation of Paxos to reach consensus on file names.

A frontend was provided and can be used by navigating to the /gui folder and running 
  go run mod.go start
